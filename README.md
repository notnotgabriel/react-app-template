# React App boilerplate

This repo is an example of how you can config your React App from scratch without using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which I must encourage you to use it.

It's very good to learn how to create the foundation of the project by yourself so you can have flexibility and space to improve over time.

It is also a boilerplate for remind my future self to how to start/or config a React App.

You can get a similar (and more complete) boilerplate using the [Create App generator](https://createapp.dev/). Also I recommend you to check the free webpack course and the paid book.
